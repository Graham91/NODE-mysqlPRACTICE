# NODE-mysqlPRACTICE
Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL using inquirer with node.
There are two apilcations in this repository. the first simulates a customer purchasing items which then updates a mysql database.
the second one simulates adding new products to the database and viewing how many items are in the database as if you were a manager.
to see both aplications in action checkout the small videos also found in the repository.
